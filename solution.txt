Solution Description:
Create a web application to read hotel data, gather the ratings from the users and allow the users to search based on topics (attributes of the hotel) that they desire. 
•	The users can chose from the different available topics
•	The system should return hotels based on the ratings for the topics the users chose

•	The web page can allow the users to get the hotel ratings based on the topic they desire.
•	The users can get more information about the hotel by looking additional hotel informations
•	The users can request to read comments left by hotel clients.

In the first phase a system will be designed to read all the hotel json files and from them produce a digest of the attributes for which it is mentioned and the values the users assigned to them. So for every hotel there will be a list of attributes for which the hotel is mentioned and the average value for each of those attributes. Based on this characteristics the attribute:value the hotel ratings will be calculated and presented to the users.

The topic search will be done by searching the comments and determining if the requested topic is present or not. If it is it will be considered the sentiment towards it based on the predefined words of the semantic file.
The way the topic search is done is by searching in every sentence of the comments to find the topic, if it is found then we search for the sentiment based on the semantic value of key words. This topic value is added to the hotels overall value of this topic (sum of the value for this particular topic from all the comments that mention it) and this is used to sort the hotels for the client.
